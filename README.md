# Telecom-churn-analysis
Mobicom, a telecom company, is concerned that the market environment of rising churn rates and declining ARPU will hit them hard as churn rate at Mobicom is relatively high. 
The management team is keen to take initiatives on this front. One of these is to roll out targeted proactive retention programs, 
which include usage enhancing marketing programs to increase minutes of usage (MOU), rate plan migration, and a bundling strategy among 
others.  

Data Details: The dataset given had 86 attributes of 66297 records, each describing overall usage of each customers,
their demographic information and the status of their subscription. The churn is captured as 1 for customers that have churned and as 0 for
customers who continue with their subscription.  

Techniques Used: Exploratory Data Analysis, Missing data treatment, Outlier treatment, Derived variables, multiple iterations of logistic regression, validating the model using ROC Curve, Gainschart, Confusion matrix

Objective:
- Identify top factors driving likelihood of churn
- Validation of survey findings. a) Whether “cost and billing” and “network and service quality” are important factors influencing churn behavior.  b) Are data usage connectivity issues turning out to be costly? In other words, is it leading to churn?
- To analyze rate plan migration as a proactive retention strategy
